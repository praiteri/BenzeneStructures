Crystalline structures of Benzene proposed by Raiteri, Martonak and Parrinello in "Exploring Polymorphism: the Case of Benzene" Angewandte Chemie International Edition (2005), 44, 3769-3773.

Note that some of the lattice parameters reported in the paper are averages obtained from MD runs at high termperature and pressure hence they may differ from those in these files, which have been obtained, when possible, after an energy minimisation at 0K.
